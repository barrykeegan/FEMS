# FEMS
FEMS: App to assist in the accurate records of forensic exhibits.

The main feature of this app is the camera which can embed a timestamp and the exhibit reference number onto the 
photograph and also save it as part of the file name. This leads to some benefits to the forensic process such as; stronger 
signal that photograph was taken when the photograph embedded date time states if it agrees with file name timestamp, if you
are trying to view images per exhibit reference you can just search by file name.

Once a case and exhibit are added to the app, you can start photographing the exhibit. Photographs are stored in private
storage internal to the app. If you require access to them you need to click on the "download" type icon on a per exhibit or
per case basis. This copies the images to the more accessible external storage area and they can then be copied off the phone
using a physical connection to a computer.

Features planned:
-- Per exhibit report
-- Per case report
